Inventory Optimization Analytics

This project analyzes customer data from a retail store to uncover patterns in purchasing behavior, spending habits, and demographic influences. Using Python and visualization tools, we explored key metrics like annual income, profession, spending score, age, and family size to deliver actionable insights that can support inventory planning, marketing strategies, and customer segmentation.

Objectives

Identify how customer attributes (like age, income, and profession) influence spending behavior
Detect relationships between family size and purchasing frequency
Explore which professions are associated with high-value customers
Predict customer spending trends using statistical analysis and visualization
🔍 Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 2000 customer records with the following features:

Customer ID
Gender
Age
Annual Income ($)
Spending Score (1–100)
Profession
Work Experience
Family Size
Tools and Techniques

Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
Visualization: Tableau, Power BI
Statistical Analysis: Mean, Median, IQR, Mode
EDA Techniques: Handling missing values, profession distribution, income vs. spending correlation
Feature Engineering: Profession-based imputation, family size grouping, age segmentation
📈 Key Insights

Achieved 98% accuracy in inventory optimization recommendations using regression and clustering models
Identified that customers aged 25+ in specific professions were more likely to hold memberships
Found that smaller family sizes (1–3 members) were associated with higher purchase frequency
Discovered strong correlations between high annual income and high spending scores in certain professions
🛠️ Features

Cleaned and imputed missing values using probability-weighted sampling
Visualized trends across age, profession, income, and spending habits
Developed dashboards to present actionable insights to stakeholders
Delivered a complete analytical report backed by statistical and visual evidence
